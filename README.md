# DeepReliability 🧠📚

## Abstract
🌐 Nowadays, AI-generated content is prevalent. Ensuring its reliability is crucial. This project focuses on evaluating the credibility of AI-generated content.

## Introduction
🚀 The rise of AI-generated content demands reliable assessment frameworks. Our work aims to develop a Deep Learning-based framework for evaluating the reliability of AI-generated responses.

### Methodology
🔬 We train deep learning models (CNN, LSTM, BiLSTM) on annotated datasets that have question-answer and ChatGPT-generated responses. Text representation techniques like Word2Vec, GloVe, BERT, FastText, and TFIDF are integrated to enhance model capabilities.

### Evaluation
📊 We evaluate model effectiveness using metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 score, and MCC. Comparative analysis explores synergies between text representation techniques and deep learning algorithms.

## Methods
🛠️ We employ BERT for Natural Language Processing (NLP) and traditional algorithms like LSVM and RF for classification tasks.

## Experimental Setup
🔍 Training and validation involve various deep learning models with crucial Python libraries like TensorFlow, Scikit-learn, and Transformers.


## Conclusion
🔑 Our research presents a comprehensive framework for evaluating the reliability of AI-generated content, fostering trust and confidence. 

## Limitations of the Study
⚠️ Acknowledging limitations in dataset representation, evaluation metrics, and resource constraints is crucial for future improvements.
